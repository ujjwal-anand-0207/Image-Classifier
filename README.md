# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree
This repository contains my submissions for the nanodegree program [AI Programming with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

Please note that the foundation of the code was provided by Udacity as a starting point for the projects.

## Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

The first project dealt with using a given image classifier in order to identify dog breeds. The focus was not on training or building the classifier, but on demonstrating the necessary Python skills for setting up a machine learning project, i.e. dealing with the data, looking at different metrics, inspecting results and run times of different classifiers.
